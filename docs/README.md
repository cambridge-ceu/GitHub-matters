## How to contribute to [cambridge-ceu](https://github.com/cambridge-ceu)

Assuming you have registered a GitHub account, simply contact owner of a repository to add yourself as a contributor.

As adapted from [Apress](https://github.com/apress), a more general approach involves the following steps:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
2. Fork a repository.
3. Create a new branch on which to make your change, e.g. `git checkout -b your_initials_or_description`
4. Commit your change. Include a commit message describing the correction. Please note that if your commit message is not clear, the correction will not be accepted.
5. Submit a pull request from your_initials_or_description.

An example is given in [Notes.md](Notes.md). More generally, it would be similar to [these instructions to GDAL](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

CAUTION (legacy) -- there are issues under cardio on GitHub synchronisation so it is appropriate to use `git pull` but not `git push` which can replace files on the server with empty ones for no reasons. Sometimes it is necessary to disable the pop-up window as described in [Notes.md](Notes.md).
