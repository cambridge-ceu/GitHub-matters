This provides some technical aspects and/or perhaps logistics related to GitHub

## Themes

1. Technical guides
   * [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) including [Hello world!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
   * [git-scm documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) including [Reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/).
   * [awesome-GitHub](https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-github)
2. Elements to consider, (e.g., data security).
3. Additional facilities, (e.g., aws, box).

CAUTION -- there are issues under cardio on GitHub synchronisation so it is appropriate to use `git pull` but not `git push` which can replace files on the server with empty ones for no reasons.
